I&#039;ve had the same problem with test results. You could try the following. It worked for us. (After this it could take a while for the cleanup job actually deletes the runs)

#get test run
$tvsprojecturi = &quot;https://azuredevopsserver/tfs/DefaultCollection/PROJECT&quot;
#get top 5000 runs

$top5000Url =  &quot;$azuredevopsprojecturi/_apis/test/runs?api-version=6.0&#038;`$top=5000&quot;
$arti = invoke-restmethod  $top5000Url -UseDefaultCredentials -Verbose

foreach($runUri in $arti.value.url)
{
     #check first if you want to delete this run
     Invoke-RestMethod  -method Delete -Uri &quot;$($runUri)?api-version=6.0&quot; -UseDefaultCredentials -Verbose
}]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, your implementation is awesome. But is there any possibility, how to report results for each test step?
As an example i have a Test code with 3 assertions (3 test steps in ADO) and i want to see in test case result, which step exactly failed/passed (e.g. step 2 will fail).
Then, when i open the test case result, i will see that steps 1 &#038; 3 were passed, and step 2 was failed. Then overall result of the test is failed]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, thank you for the post but I have a question about on of the steps. 
What to do to associate tests cases when working on Mac? Visual Studio on Mac doesn’t have a Test Explorer so the association in a way that is described in the post is not possible. Do you know what might be a way to associate the automated test cases on Mac?]]></description>
