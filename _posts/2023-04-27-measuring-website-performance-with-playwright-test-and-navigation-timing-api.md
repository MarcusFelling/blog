In this post, we will explore how to measure website performance using Playwright Test and the Navigation Timing API. Playwright is a powerful end-to-end testing framework, and the Navigation Timing API provides detailed timing information about the loading of a webpage.

## Setting Up Playwright

To get started with Playwright, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 1: Install Playwright

To install Playwright, run the following command in your project directory:

```sh
npm install playwright
```

### Step 2: Create a Playwright Test Script

Create a new file in your project directory and add the following code to create a simple Playwright test script:

```js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  const performanceTiming = await page.evaluate(() => JSON.stringify(window.performance.timing));
  console.log(JSON.parse(performanceTiming));
  await browser.close();
})();
```

This script launches a Chromium browser, navigates to a website, retrieves the performance timing information using the Navigation Timing API, and then closes the browser.

## Analyzing Performance Timing Data

The Navigation Timing API provides various metrics that can help you analyze the performance of your website. Here are some key metrics:

- `navigationStart`: The time when the navigation started.
- `domContentLoadedEventEnd`: The time when the DOMContentLoaded event completed.
- `loadEventEnd`: The time when the load event completed.

You can use these metrics to calculate the time taken for different stages of the page load process.

### Example: Calculating Page Load Time

Here is an example of how to calculate the page load time using the performance timing data:

```js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  const performanceTiming = await page.evaluate(() => JSON.stringify(window.performance.timing));
  const timing = JSON.parse(performanceTiming);
  const pageLoadTime = timing.loadEventEnd - timing.navigationStart;
  console.log(`Page Load Time: ${pageLoadTime} ms`);
  await browser.close();
})();
```

This script calculates the page load time by subtracting the `navigationStart` time from the `loadEventEnd` time.

## Conclusion

By using Playwright Test and the Navigation Timing API, you can measure and analyze the performance of your website. This allows you to identify bottlenecks and optimize the loading time of your web pages. With Playwright's powerful automation capabilities and the detailed timing information provided by the Navigation Timing API, you can ensure that your website delivers a fast and smooth user experience.
