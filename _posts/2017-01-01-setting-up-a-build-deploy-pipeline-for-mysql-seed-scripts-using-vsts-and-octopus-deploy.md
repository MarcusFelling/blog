In this post, we will explore how to set up a build and deploy pipeline for MySQL seed scripts using VSTS (Visual Studio Team Services) and Octopus Deploy. This pipeline will automate the process of building, testing, and deploying MySQL seed scripts to different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A VSTS account and a project
- Octopus Deploy installed and configured
- A MySQL database
- MySQL seed scripts

## Step 1: Create a VSTS Build Definition

First, create a new build definition in VSTS. Follow these steps:

1. Go to your VSTS project and navigate to the "Build and Release" section.
2. Click on "New" and select "New build pipeline".
3. Choose the repository that contains your MySQL seed scripts.
4. Select the build template that best fits your needs. For this example, we will use the "Empty" template.
5. Add the following tasks to your build definition:

### Task 1: Copy Files

Add a "Copy Files" task to copy the MySQL seed scripts to the build artifact staging directory. Configure the task as follows:

- Source Folder: The folder that contains your MySQL seed scripts
- Contents: **\*.sql
- Target Folder: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)

### Task 2: Publish Build Artifacts

Add a "Publish Build Artifacts" task to publish the MySQL seed scripts as build artifacts. Configure the task as follows:

- Path to Publish: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
- Artifact Name: drop
- Artifact Type: Server

Save and queue the build definition to create a build artifact containing your MySQL seed scripts.

## Step 2: Create an Octopus Deploy Project

Next, create a new project in Octopus Deploy. Follow these steps:

1. Go to your Octopus Deploy instance and navigate to the "Projects" section.
2. Click on "Add Project" and enter a name and description for your project.
3. Click on "Process" and add the following steps to your deployment process:

### Step 1: Deploy MySQL Seed Scripts

Add a "Run a Script" step to deploy the MySQL seed scripts to your database. Configure the step as follows:

- Script Source: Inline Source Code
- Inline Source Code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Define the MySQL connection details
MYSQL_HOST="your_mysql_host"
MYSQL_USER="your_mysql_user"
MYSQL_PASSWORD="your_mysql_password"
MYSQL_DATABASE="your_mysql_database"

# Define the path to the MySQL seed scripts
SEED_SCRIPTS_PATH="path_to_seed_scripts"

# Execute each MySQL seed script
for script in $SEED_SCRIPTS_PATH/*.sql; do
  mysql -h $MYSQL_HOST -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE < $script
done
```

Save the deployment process.

## Step 3: Create a Release and Deploy

Finally, create a release and deploy the MySQL seed scripts to your database. Follow these steps:

1. Go to your Octopus Deploy project and navigate to the "Releases" section.
2. Click on "Create Release" and select the build artifact created in Step 1.
3. Click on "Deploy" and select the environment to deploy to.
4. Monitor the deployment process to ensure the MySQL seed scripts are successfully deployed to your database.

## Conclusion

By setting up a build and deploy pipeline for MySQL seed scripts using VSTS and Octopus Deploy, you can automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your MySQL seed scripts to different environments. This approach helps ensure consistency and reliability in your database deployments, making it easier to manage and maintain your MySQL databases.
