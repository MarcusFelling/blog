In this post, we will explore how to use task groups in TFS/VSTS to simplify and standardize your build and release pipelines. Task groups allow you to encapsulate a sequence of tasks into a single reusable unit, making it easier to manage and maintain your pipelines.

## What are Task Groups?

Task groups are a feature in TFS/VSTS that allow you to group a set of tasks into a single reusable unit. This can be useful when you have a sequence of tasks that you need to use in multiple build or release pipelines. By creating a task group, you can define the sequence of tasks once and then reuse it across multiple pipelines.

## Benefits of Using Task Groups

1. **Reusability**: Task groups allow you to define a sequence of tasks once and reuse it across multiple pipelines, reducing duplication and making it easier to maintain your pipelines.
2. **Consistency**: By using task groups, you can ensure that the same sequence of tasks is used consistently across your pipelines, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.
3. **Simplified Management**: Task groups make it easier to manage and maintain your pipelines by encapsulating a sequence of tasks into a single unit. This can simplify the process of updating and maintaining your pipelines.

## Creating a Task Group

To create a task group in TFS/VSTS, follow these steps:

1. Open the build or release pipeline where you want to create the task group.
2. Select the tasks that you want to include in the task group.
3. Right-click on the selected tasks and choose "Create task group".
4. Provide a name and description for the task group.
5. Click "Create" to create the task group.

## Using a Task Group

Once you have created a task group, you can use it in your build or release pipelines by following these steps:

1. Open the build or release pipeline where you want to use the task group.
2. Click on the "+" button to add a new task.
3. Search for the task group by name and select it from the list.
4. Configure the task group as needed and save your pipeline.

## Managing Task Groups

You can manage your task groups in TFS/VSTS by following these steps:

1. Open the "Task groups" page in the TFS/VSTS web portal.
2. From here, you can view, edit, and delete your task groups.
3. You can also create new task groups and update existing ones as needed.

## Conclusion

Task groups are a powerful feature in TFS/VSTS that can help you simplify and standardize your build and release pipelines. By encapsulating a sequence of tasks into a single reusable unit, you can reduce duplication, ensure consistency, and simplify the management of your pipelines. By following the steps outlined in this post, you can start using task groups in your TFS/VSTS pipelines and take advantage of the benefits they offer.
