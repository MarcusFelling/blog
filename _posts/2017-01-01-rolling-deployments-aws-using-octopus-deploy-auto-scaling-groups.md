In this post, we will explore how to perform rolling deployments in AWS using Octopus Deploy and Auto Scaling Groups. Rolling deployments allow you to update your application instances gradually, minimizing downtime and reducing the risk of deployment failures.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account with administrative privileges
- Octopus Deploy installed and configured
- An Auto Scaling Group set up in AWS
- A deployment target configured in Octopus Deploy

## Step 1: Create a Deployment Project in Octopus Deploy

First, create a new deployment project in Octopus Deploy. Open the Octopus Deploy web portal and navigate to the "Projects" section. Click on the "Add Project" button and provide a name and description for your project.

## Step 2: Define the Deployment Process

Next, define the deployment process for your project. Click on the "Process" tab and add the necessary deployment steps. For a rolling deployment, you will need to add the following steps:

1. **Deploy to Staging**: Deploy the new version of your application to a staging environment for testing.
2. **Health Check**: Perform a health check on the staging environment to ensure the new version is working correctly.
3. **Deploy to Production**: Deploy the new version to the production environment using a rolling deployment strategy.

## Step 3: Configure the Rolling Deployment Step

To configure the rolling deployment step, click on the "Deploy to Production" step and select the "Rolling Deployment" option. Configure the following settings:

- **Batch Size**: Specify the number of instances to update at a time. For example, if you have 10 instances in your Auto Scaling Group and set the batch size to 2, Octopus Deploy will update 2 instances at a time.
- **Health Check**: Enable the health check option to ensure each batch of instances is healthy before proceeding to the next batch.
- **Wait Time**: Specify the wait time between batches. This allows you to monitor the deployment and ensure each batch is stable before proceeding.

## Step 4: Deploy the Application

Once you have configured the rolling deployment step, you can deploy your application. Click on the "Create Release" button and provide a version number for your release. Click on the "Deploy" button to start the deployment process.

Octopus Deploy will update your application instances in batches, performing health checks and waiting between batches to ensure a smooth deployment.

## Conclusion

By using Octopus Deploy and Auto Scaling Groups, you can perform rolling deployments in AWS, minimizing downtime and reducing the risk of deployment failures. This approach allows you to update your application instances gradually, ensuring each batch is healthy before proceeding to the next batch. With Octopus Deploy, you can automate and streamline your deployment process, improving the efficiency and reliability of your deployments.
