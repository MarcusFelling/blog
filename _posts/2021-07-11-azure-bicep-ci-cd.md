Hey, you. Youâ€™re not manually deploying your [Azure Bicep](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview) Infrastructure as Code, are you?!? Letâ€™s prevent that next production outage, help your team collaborate on changes, and enable more frequent deployments. In this post, Iâ€™ll outline what tooling is available to integrate Bicep in your pipelines, and some good practices for building and deploying.

## Resources to get started

If youâ€™re new to Azure Bicep, Iâ€™d recommend checking out the [Microsoft Learn learning path for Bicep](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/bicep-deploy/). There are also great resources for the basics on [Deploying Bicep files by using GitHub Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/deploy-github-actions) and [Integrating Bicep with Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/add-template-to-azure-pipelines). Once you have the fundamentals covered, you may find the remainder of this post helpful.

## Build 

### Tooling

Iâ€™m going to break things down into 2 phases of the pipeline: 1. build 2. deploy. For the build phase, we have multiple options for tooling:

- **Bicep CLI** â€“ now included in Azure Pipelines [Microsoft-hosted agents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) and GitHub Actions [hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners). You can also add script steps to install on self-hosted agents [based on OS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#install-manually).
- **Azure CLI** â€“ Bicep is now included in v2.20.0 or later. Installing Bicep is as simple as running `az bicep install`
- [**Bicep GitHub Action**](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/bicep-build) â€“ Action built and maintained by a community member.
- [**Bicep extension for Azure Pipelines**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piraces.bicep-tasks) â€“ Set of Azure Pipeline tasks built and maintained by a community member.

### Good Practices

I like to set up the build phase early in my pipeline, in order to fail fast and speed up the feedback loop. The build should make sure 3 things happen:

- Ensure transpilation (conversion to ARM template) is successful.
- Ensure linting rules pass. Configure [bicepconfig.json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/linter#customize-linter) to throw an error on important rule violations.
- Ensure preflight validaton is successful.

To combine all of the above using a single command, validation commands can be used. For a resource group deployment, I can use the [Azure CLI command](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/deployment/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az_deployment_group_validate) `az deployment group validate` or Azure PowerShellâ€™s [Test-AzResourceGroupDeployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.resources/test-azresourcegroupdeployment).

For an example of this using GitHub Actions, check out my SpaceGameVNextâ€™s pipeline [here](https://github.com/MarcusFelling/demo-space-game-vnext/blob/12b081894b10b581bdfeaedfce69a0f5165891b3/.github/workflows/pipeline.yml#L83).

## Deploy

### Tooling

Similar to build, we have multiple options for deployment:

- **Azure CLI** â€“ no install needed v2.20.0 or later. I can issue a deployment command pointed at a Bicep template and Bicep will be downloaded and installed on the fly, behind the scenes.
- **Azure PowerShell** â€“ Unfortunately Azure PowerShell doesnâ€™t automatically install the Bicep CLI. Instead, you must [manually install the Bicep CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#install-manually).
- [Deploy Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-azure-resource-manager-arm-template) â€“ Action built and maintained by Microsoft Azure. Now supports Bicep.
- [ARM template deployment Azure Pipeline task](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeploymentV3) 
- Official Azure Pipeline task. No native Bicep support. Requires referencing transpiled ARM Template.

### Good Practices

I like to promote the same set of templates for all environments (dev -> test -> prod). This encourages the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) (Donâ€™t repeat yourself) principle. In order to make this happen, I can:

- Use [conditions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/conditional-resource-deployment) on resources that may differ. For example, if I only want to [use deployment slots in production](https://github.com/MarcusFelling/Demo.SpaceGamevNext/blob/12b081894b10b581bdfeaedfce69a0f5165891b3/IaC/webapp.bicep#L96).
- Use [ternary expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/operators-logical) on properties that differ. For example, if I want to [use different storage account SKUâ€™s](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/blob/main/docs/tutorial/03-using-expressions.md#using-the-ternary-operator).
- Leverage pipeline environment variables to re-use same steps for each environment.

Additionally,

- Do not store secret values in templates. If you use Key Vault, check out [Use Azure Key Vault to pass secure parameter value during Bicep deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/key-vault-parameter?tabs=azure-cli).
- [Use what-if to preview changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/arm-template-whatif/). This is a great way to review the impact your changes will have via dry-run.
- Cleanup dev/test environment resources when no longer needed. I like to have a separate pipeline that getâ€™s triggered on the merge of PR, that destroyâ€™s resources that were created for the sole purpose of testing that PRâ€™s change.

For an example of this using GitHub Actions, check out my SpaceGameVNextâ€™s pipeline [here](https://github.com/MarcusFelling/demo-space-game-vnext/blob/main/.github/workflows/pipeline.yml).

## Summary

None of this is hard and fast guidance to follow strictly. There are many different types of architectures, environments, repository structures, etc. These are things that Iâ€™ve found success with and YMMV. What have you found success in while integrating Bicep into your pipelines? I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments.
