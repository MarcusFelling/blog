In this post, we will explore how to use Azure Test Plans with Playwright to create and manage automated tests for your web applications. Azure Test Plans is a powerful tool that allows you to plan, track, and manage your testing efforts, while Playwright is a popular end-to-end testing framework for web applications.

## Setting Up Azure Test Plans

To get started with Azure Test Plans, you need to have an Azure DevOps account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free at [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/).

### Step 1: Create a New Project

Once you have an Azure DevOps account, create a new project by clicking on the "New Project" button. Give your project a name and select the visibility (public or private) and version control (Git or Team Foundation Version Control).

### Step 2: Create a Test Plan

After creating your project, navigate to the "Test Plans" section and click on the "New Test Plan" button. Give your test plan a name and select the area path and iteration path for your tests.

### Step 3: Create Test Suites and Test Cases

Within your test plan, you can create test suites and test cases. Test suites are used to group related test cases, while test cases define the individual tests that you want to run. To create a test suite, click on the "New Test Suite" button and give it a name. To create a test case, click on the "New Test Case" button and fill in the details, such as the title, steps, and expected results.

## Integrating Playwright with Azure Test Plans

Now that you have set up your test plan, you can integrate Playwright with Azure Test Plans to automate your tests.

### Step 1: Install Playwright

To install Playwright, run the following command in your project directory:

```sh
npm install playwright
```

### Step 2: Create a Playwright Test Script

Create a new file in your project directory and add the following code to create a simple Playwright test script:

```js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'example.png' });
  await browser.close();
})();
```

This script launches a Chromium browser, navigates to a website, takes a screenshot, and then closes the browser.

### Step 3: Run Playwright Tests from Azure Pipelines

To run your Playwright tests from Azure Pipelines, you need to create a pipeline configuration file. Create a new file named `azure-pipelines.yml` in your project directory and add the following configuration:

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.x'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script: |
    npm install
    npm test
  displayName: 'Run Playwright Tests'
```

This configuration triggers the pipeline on changes to the `main` branch, installs Node.js, and runs your Playwright tests.

## Conclusion

By integrating Azure Test Plans with Playwright, you can create and manage automated tests for your web applications. This allows you to ensure the quality of your applications and streamline your testing efforts. With Azure Test Plans, you can plan, track, and manage your testing efforts, while Playwright provides a powerful framework for end-to-end testing.
