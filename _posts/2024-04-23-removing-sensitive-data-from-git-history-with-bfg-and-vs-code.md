In this post, we will discuss how to remove sensitive data from your Git history using BFG Repo-Cleaner and Visual Studio Code. This is a crucial step to ensure that sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and other confidential data are not exposed in your repository's history.

## Why Remove Sensitive Data from Git History?

When you commit changes to a Git repository, the entire history of those changes is stored. This means that even if you remove sensitive data from your files and commit the changes, the sensitive data still exists in the previous commits. This can pose a security risk if someone gains access to your repository's history.

## Using BFG Repo-Cleaner

BFG Repo-Cleaner is a tool designed to remove large files or sensitive data from your Git repository's history. It is faster and simpler than using Git's built-in filter-branch command.

### Step 1: Install BFG Repo-Cleaner

To install BFG Repo-Cleaner, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download BFG Repo-Cleaner from its [official website](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).

### Step 2: Clone Your Repository

Clone your repository to your local machine using the `--mirror` option. This creates a bare repository that includes all branches and tags.

```sh
git clone --mirror https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

### Step 3: Run BFG Repo-Cleaner

Run BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove the sensitive data. For example, to remove all files named `passwords.txt`, use the following command:

```sh
bfg --delete-files passwords.txt your-repo.git
```

### Step 4: Clean Up and Push Changes

After running BFG Repo-Cleaner, you need to clean up your repository and push the changes to the remote repository.

```sh
cd your-repo.git
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push --force
```

## Using Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful code editor that can help you identify and remove sensitive data from your files before committing changes.

### Step 1: Install the GitLens Extension

Install the GitLens extension for VS Code. This extension provides advanced Git capabilities, including the ability to view the history of a file and identify changes.

### Step 2: Search for Sensitive Data

Use the search functionality in VS Code to search for sensitive data in your files. For example, you can search for keywords such as "password", "API key", or "secret".

### Step 3: Remove Sensitive Data

Remove the sensitive data from your files and commit the changes. Make sure to follow the steps outlined in the "Using BFG Repo-Cleaner" section to remove the sensitive data from your repository's history.

## Conclusion

Removing sensitive data from your Git history is an important step to ensure the security of your repository. By using tools like BFG Repo-Cleaner and Visual Studio Code, you can effectively remove sensitive data and prevent it from being exposed in your repository's history.
