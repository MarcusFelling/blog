In Azure DevOps, managing multiple release pipelines can be a daunting task, especially when you need to update tasks across all pipelines. This post will guide you through the process of bulk updating Azure Release Pipelines tasks using PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Azure DevOps account
2. Personal Access Token (PAT) with sufficient permissions
3. PowerShell installed on your machine

## Step 1: Install Azure DevOps Extension for PowerShell

First, you need to install the Azure DevOps extension for PowerShell. Open PowerShell and run the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az.DevOps -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Step 2: Authenticate to Azure DevOps

Next, authenticate to your Azure DevOps account using your PAT. Run the following command:

```powershell
$personalAccessToken = "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
$organizationUrl = "https://dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORGANIZATION"

$base64AuthInfo = [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes(":$($personalAccessToken)"))
```

## Step 3: Get List of Release Pipelines

Retrieve the list of release pipelines in your Azure DevOps project. Run the following command:

```powershell
$project = "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"
$uri = "$organizationUrl/$project/_apis/release/definitions?api-version=6.0"

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Get -Headers @{Authorization=("Basic {0}" -f $base64AuthInfo)}
$releasePipelines = $response.value
```

## Step 4: Update Tasks in Release Pipelines

Loop through each release pipeline and update the tasks as needed. For example, to update the version of a specific task, run the following command:

```powershell
foreach ($pipeline in $releasePipelines) {
    $pipelineId = $pipeline.id
    $uri = "$organizationUrl/$project/_apis/release/definitions/$pipelineId?api-version=6.0"
    
    $pipelineDefinition = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Get -Headers @{Authorization=("Basic {0}" -f $base64AuthInfo)}
    
    foreach ($environment in $pipelineDefinition.environments) {
        foreach ($phase in $environment.deployPhases) {
            foreach ($task in $phase.workflowTasks) {
                if ($task.taskId -eq "SPECIFIC_TASK_ID") {
                    $task.version = "NEW_VERSION"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    $uri = "$organizationUrl/$project/_apis/release/definitions/$pipelineId?api-version=6.0"
    $body = $pipelineDefinition | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Put -Headers @{Authorization=("Basic {0}" -f $base64AuthInfo)} -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
}
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can efficiently bulk update tasks in your Azure Release Pipelines using PowerShell. This approach saves time and ensures consistency across all your release pipelines.
