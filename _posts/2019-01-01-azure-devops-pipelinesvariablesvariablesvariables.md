Azure DevOps PipelinesVariablesVariablesVariables are a powerful feature that allows you to define and manage variables in your pipelines. These variables can be used to store values that can be reused across multiple pipeline stages, jobs, and steps.

## Types of Pipeline Variables

There are several types of pipeline variables in Azure DevOps:

- **Pipeline Variables**: These are defined at the pipeline level and can be used across all stages, jobs, and steps in the pipeline.
- **Stage Variables**: These are defined at the stage level and can be used within the stage and its jobs and steps.
- **Job Variables**: These are defined at the job level and can be used within the job and its steps.
- **Step Variables**: These are defined at the step level and can be used within the step.

## Defining Pipeline Variables

You can define pipeline variables in the pipeline YAML file or through the Azure DevOps portal.

### Defining Variables in YAML

To define variables in the pipeline YAML file, use the `variables` keyword. Here is an example:

```yaml
variables:
  - name: myVariable
    value: myValue
```

### Defining Variables in the Azure DevOps Portal

To define variables in the Azure DevOps portal, navigate to the pipeline and click on the "Variables" tab. Click on the "Add" button to add a new variable, and provide the name and value for the variable.

## Using Pipeline Variables

Once you have defined pipeline variables, you can use them in your pipeline by referencing their names. Here is an example of how to use a pipeline variable in a script step:

```yaml
steps:
  - script: echo $(myVariable)
    displayName: "Print myVariable"
```

## Variable Groups

Variable groups allow you to manage a collection of variables and make them available to multiple pipelines. This is useful for sharing common variables across multiple pipelines.

### Creating a Variable Group

To create a variable group, navigate to the "Library" section in Azure DevOps and click on the "Variable groups" tab. Click on the "Add variable group" button to create a new variable group, and provide the name and variables for the group.

### Using a Variable Group in a Pipeline

To use a variable group in a pipeline, reference the variable group in the pipeline YAML file. Here is an example:

```yaml
variables:
- group: myVariableGroup
```

## Secret Variables

Secret variables are used to store sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and tokens. These variables are encrypted and can be used in your pipeline without exposing their values.

### Defining Secret Variables

To define secret variables, navigate to the pipeline and click on the "Variables" tab. Click on the "Add" button to add a new variable, and provide the name and value for the variable. Check the "Keep this value secret" checkbox to mark the variable as a secret.

### Using Secret Variables

To use secret variables in your pipeline, reference their names just like regular variables. Here is an example:

```yaml
steps:
  - script: echo $(mySecretVariable)
    displayName: "Print mySecretVariable"
```

By using pipeline variables, you can store values that can be reused across multiple pipeline stages, jobs, and steps, making your pipelines more flexible and maintainable.
