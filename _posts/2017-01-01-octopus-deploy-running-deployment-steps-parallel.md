In this post, we will explore how to run deployment steps in parallel using Octopus Deploy. Running deployment steps in parallel can significantly reduce the overall deployment time, especially for large and complex applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- An Octopus Deploy server and a project set up
- Deployment steps configured in your project
- Appropriate permissions to modify the deployment process

## Step 1: Enable Parallel Deployment

To enable parallel deployment in Octopus Deploy, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your project in the Octopus Deploy web portal.
2. Click on the "Process" tab to view the deployment process.
3. Identify the steps that you want to run in parallel.
4. Click on the step that you want to modify to open its settings.
5. In the step settings, find the "Run Condition" section.
6. Select the "Run in parallel with other steps" option.
7. Save the changes.

Repeat these steps for each deployment step that you want to run in parallel.

## Step 2: Configure Step Dependencies

When running steps in parallel, it's important to configure step dependencies to ensure that steps are executed in the correct order. To configure step dependencies, follow these steps:

1. In the "Process" tab, click on the step that you want to modify.
2. In the step settings, find the "Dependencies" section.
3. Add the steps that must be completed before this step can run.
4. Save the changes.

Repeat these steps for each deployment step to configure the dependencies.

## Step 3: Test the Parallel Deployment

After enabling parallel deployment and configuring step dependencies, it's important to test the deployment process to ensure that everything works as expected. To test the parallel deployment, follow these steps:

1. Create a new release in your project.
2. Deploy the release to a test environment.
3. Monitor the deployment process to ensure that the steps are running in parallel and in the correct order.

If you encounter any issues, review the step settings and dependencies to ensure that they are configured correctly.

## Conclusion

Running deployment steps in parallel using Octopus Deploy can significantly reduce the overall deployment time for large and complex applications. By following the steps outlined in this post, you can enable parallel deployment, configure step dependencies, and test the deployment process to ensure that everything works as expected. This approach can help you streamline your deployment process and improve the efficiency of your deployments.
