					<description><![CDATA[I just ran into an issue with the YAML pipelines. We are following GitFlow with some rules that are strictly enforced, for example the release needs to have work items associated. In GitFlow you create a release branch to start a release, the new branch triggers a new build and the environments can do a diff to check what work items are associated with the new release. In YAML, not so much, since the commit has already been build by CI elsewhere (the develop branch) and the work item associated there or even further back (feature branch) the work item does not get associated with the new run and the QA people will not let the release be deployed since they don&#039;t have the work item traceability.]]></description>
