Stan,

I probably didn&#039;t word that correctly. I didn&#039;t mean to say that we didn&#039;t use a release branch, I meant to say we merge develop -&gt; release (via Pull Request) instead of creating a NEW release branch.

					<description><![CDATA[Good read!

&quot;There really isn’t any benefit to cutting a new release branch off of develop when you can just create a pull request to merge the changes.&quot;

I disagree;
The reason we create a release branch is to prepare everything before we create a PR. The release branch could trigger for example integration testing so we can catch bugs in advance and create bugfixes on the release branch before creating a PR to master. The release branch also merges back into develop whenever we commit something to it.
