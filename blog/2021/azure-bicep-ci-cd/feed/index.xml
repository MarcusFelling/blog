Thanks for replying Marcus, Iâ€™m just going to stick with the linter now then as it works a treat so far

Iâ€™m looking forward to testing out deployment stacks. I can imagine more people are moving towards subscription scope deploys now, so this will prove very useful!]]></description>

Thanks, Paul!

1. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/linter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Bicep linter&lt;/a&gt; shifts more validations left, into VS Code while you&#039;re authoring templates. We&#039;re working to meet parity with all of the arm-ttk tests that make sense. We&#039;ve had quite a few ideas submitted for linting rules (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Azure/bicep/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Alinting-rule-idea&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Beyond IDE tests, I&#039;d recommend leveraging pre-flight validation and what-if, as mentioned above.

2.  The ARM Deployments team is working on a new feature called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4E5DsC-RcU&#038;t=1658s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Deployment Stacks&lt;/a&gt; that will improve resource lifecycle management. It should be in private preview soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great blog post Marcus, thanks for posting!

I tend to use the CLI tasks for my deployments (Iâ€™ve been using your repo mentioned above as a starting point) and it works really well

Few questions if I may:

1) What are your opinions on testing the templates, is there a tool similar to the ARM-TTK coming for bicep? Testing for things like out of date API versions etc

2) I like the subscription scope deployment, but doing it that way means missing out on switching from incremental/complete modes when needed, to remove resources that are no longer in the template, like you can do with a RG scope. Is something like that coming soon?
