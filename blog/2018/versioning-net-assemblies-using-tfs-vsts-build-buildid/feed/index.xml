Yann,

Versioning based on Git commit is an excellent idea! Going to take it for a test drive. I really appreciate your help. Thanks for chiming in.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi. I haven&#039;t used it yet, but maybe https://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.GitVersioning would be helpful? It&#039;s on my backlog to move to using it. 

If you&#039;re anything like me you&#039;ll need to try to ignore the &quot;Nerdbank&quot; namespace. Andrew Arnott actually works at Microsoft, and he definitely knows what he&#039;s doing. I don&#039;t know why he chose that namespace, but who knows, there might be some historical reason it&#039;s still there.

Anyway, it definitely would satisfy your stated requirement: &quot;The build id is used so we have traceability when troubleshooting. We can easily search for the build and see the associated changes&quot;.
