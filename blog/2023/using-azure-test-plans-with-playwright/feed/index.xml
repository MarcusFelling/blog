Here is the YAML:
steps:
- powershell: &#124;
   pwsh playwright.ps1 install --with-deps
   
  workingDirectory: &#039;$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_PlaywrightDotnet/PlaywrightTests/PlaywrightTests&#039;
  displayName: &#039;Install Playwright browsers&#039;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great tutorial! Just a question: 
What is in the Powershell script called &quot;Install playwright browsers&quot; from the release pipeline (Playwright .NET)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, your implementation is awesome. But is there any possibility, how to report results for each test step?
As an example i have a Test code with 3 assertions (3 test steps in ADO) and i want to see in test case result, which step exactly failed/passed (e.g. step 2 will fail).
Then, when i open the test case result, i will see that steps 1 &#038; 3 were passed, and step 2 was failed. Then overall result of the test is failed]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, thank you for the post but I have a question about on of the steps. 
What to do to associate tests cases when working on Mac? Visual Studio on Mac doesn’t have a Test Explorer so the association in a way that is described in the post is not possible. Do you know what might be a way to associate the automated test cases on Mac?]]></description>

Correct. The Playwright config references an env variable for the PAT that is set by the pipeline: https://dev.azure.com/marcusfelling/Playground/_git/PlaywrightTest?path=/playwright-test.yml&amp;version=GBmain&amp;line=17&amp;lineEnd=18&amp;lineStartColumn=1&amp;lineEndColumn=1&amp;lineStyle=plain&amp;_a=contents]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for sharing this awesome article.
I have the tests running and reporting to test plans though I have a challenge accessing the ADO token when set as a secret variable, only works when the token is set as a regular variable. Could you kindly share your pipeline YAML file for reference on how you are setting/accessing the token.

I would also appreciate if you could write an article on setting up the pipelines for the Playwright Test (TypeScript).]]></description>
